email for ecommerce site

write a test:

order_email_spec.rb

describe 'an order confirmation email' do

  it 'is sent when an order is created' do
    expect { Order.create(number_of_Items : 3) }.to change { emails.count }.by 1

    # alternative way - but we're creating a helper method, called emails
    #old_email_count = emails.count
    #Order.create
    #expect(emails.count).to eq (old_email_count + 1)
  end

  it 'should have the subject "Order Confirmation"' do
    expect(emails.last.subject).to eq "Order Confirmation"
  end

  it 'should include the nuber of items ordered' do
    expect(emails.last.body).to match /3 items/
  end

  it 'should be from "Dave's Bike Store"' do

  end

  it 'should be sent to the order customer' do

  end

end

testing when the order is sent is tricky:
  could use some stubs or some helper method

first test fails as no model for Order so:
  rails g model Order number_of_items integer

in Order model, create a hook to send the email, using the after method
  models can't send emails so in the order method

  rails generate mailer OrderNotifier
    #this will also create a new views folder for you which is where you'll store the body of the email confirmation message
